Banking Data Analysis in SQL
Project Overview
This project aims to perform in-depth analysis of banking transaction data using SQL queries. The goal is to extract valuable insights to help understand customer behavior, identify trends, and detect potential fraudulent activities. The analysis includes various SQL operations to query and summarize data from customer accounts, transactions, and branches.

Operations Included
1. Inactive Customers Query
Objective: Identify customers who haven't made any transactions in the last year.
Query Insight: Write a query to list all such customers, and suggest strategies to make them active again, considering their region.

2. Monthly Transaction Summary
Objective: Summarize the total transaction amount per account for each month.
Approach: Group transactions by account and month to display the total sum.

3. Branch Ranking Based on Deposits
Objective: Rank branches based on the total deposit amount in the last quarter.
Method: Use SQL aggregation and sorting functions to list branches in descending order of total deposits.

4. Highest Depositor Identification
Objective: Find the name of the customer who has deposited the highest amount.
Approach: Write a query to identify the customer with the largest total deposit.

5. Detecting Potential Fraud
Objective: Identify accounts that have made more than two transactions in a single day, which could indicate fraudulent activity.
Verification Strategy: Develop a method to verify suspicious transactions, such as cross-checking timestamps or analyzing the frequency of transactions.

6. Average Number of Transactions per Customer per Account per Month
Objective: Calculate the average number of transactions per customer for each account per month over the last year.
Method: Use SQL functions to aggregate transaction counts and divide by the number of months.

7. Daily Transaction Volume
Objective: Find the total daily transaction volume for the past month.
Approach: Write a query to aggregate daily totals of all transactions over the past month.

8. Total Transaction Amount by Age Group
Objective: Calculate the total transaction amount performed by each age group in the past year.
Age Groups: 0-17, 18-30, 31-60, 60+.
Method: Use SQL CASE statements to segment transactions by age group and aggregate totals.

9. Branch with the Highest Average Account Balance
Objective: Identify the branch with the highest average account balance.
Approach: Calculate the average balance for each branch and find the maximum value.

10. Average Balance per Customer at the End of Each Month
Objective: Calculate the average balance per customer at the end of each month for the last year.
Method: Use SQL to find the end-of-month balance for each customer and calculate the average.

Technologies Used
Database Management System (DBMS): SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
SQL Functions: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), GROUP BY, ORDER BY, CASE, and date functions.
Setup and Installation
Database Configuration: Ensure you have a SQL database set up with the required tables (e.g., customers, transactions, branches).
Running the Queries: Execute the provided SQL queries using your SQL client or integrated development environment.
